# GolfGame

This is my first game using the pygame library in python.

My goal is to create a golf game with:
1. A timer that requires you to finish the round in a certain amount of time
2. A score that tracks your time to complete and number of scores
3. At least one golf hole

I'm started working on this project by following the ultimate introduction to pygame by Clear Code (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY9MnQ4x3zk) to set up the intial conditions like window, how to create images, etc...
